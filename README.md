├── data/
│   ├── ab_data.csv              # Dataset for web conversion A/B test (new_page vs old_page)
│   └── campaigns.csv            # Dataset for campaign effectiveness analysis
├── AB testing A step by step guide in Python.ipynb    # Statistical theory + practical walkthrough
├── CaseStudy campaigns AB testing.ipynb               # Real-world business campaign A/B test
└── README.md
```

## ✅ Objectives Covered

Both notebooks cover:

1. **Experiment Design** – Hypothesis generation, test structure
2. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Ingesting structured CSVs
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Insightful summaries & visualizations
4. **Statistical Testing** – z-test, t-test, p-value analysis
5. **Interpretation** – Drawing conclusions, practical business suggestions

## 📊 Datasets Used

- **`ab_data.csv`**: Simulates web page conversions across `control` and `treatment` groups
- **`campaigns.csv`**: Contains engagement and conversion metrics for different marketing campaign variants
